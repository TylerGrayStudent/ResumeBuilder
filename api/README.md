# BunExpress

This repository is a learning project where I explore different tech stacks by building multiple APIs and UIs. The current setup includes an Express.js API running on Bun, using Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database.

## Project Structure

- **Express.js API**: A RESTful API built with Express.js.
- **Bun**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- **Prisma ORM**: An ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
```

### Running the API

To run the Express.js API, use:

```bash
bun --hot run ./index.ts
```
